## Overview

The webpage design features a clean and modern layout with the following elements:

1. **Header**: 
   - Logo on the left.
   - Navigation links ("Login" and "Sign up") on the right.

2. **Main Section**:
   - A prominent headline with a subheading.
   - A call-to-action button ("Sign up free") centered below the text.
   - Decorative abstract shapes in the background.

3. **Image Section**:
   - Two overlapping smartphone images showcasing a QR code and a messaging interface.

4. **How It Works Section**:
   - Three steps with icons and descriptions.
   - Another call-to-action button ("Start Jiving").

5. **Footer**:
   - Logo and additional links ("About", "Privacy", "Terms", "Contact").

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox or Grid**: Use CSS Flexbox for the header and footer for easy alignment. The main and "How It Works" sections can benefit from CSS Grid for structured layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the design is responsive, adjusting the layout for different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Background Shapes**: Use CSS for the abstract shapes, possibly as background images or SVGs for scalability.
